# Trello Card Scheduler

The Trello Card Scheduler is a full-stack web application designed to automate the creation of recurring Trello cards. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating detailed schedules and a powerful backend scheduler to handle the card creation process automatically. The application features a complete authentication system with role-based access for regular users and administrators.

## âœ¨ Major Features

### For All Users:

* **Secure Login:** Users can log in to the application with their credentials to access their schedules.
* **Side-Panel Layout:** A modern, two-column layout with a persistent left sidebar for easy navigation and a main content area for focused tasks.
* **Categorized & Collapsible Schedule List:** Schedules are neatly organized into collapsible categories in the side panel.
* **Expandable Schedule Details:** Each schedule in the list can be expanded to show more details, including its full frequency, active dates, and a link to its active Trello card.
* **Schedule Creation & Management:** Users can create, edit, and delete their own schedules with a detailed form that includes:
    * Title, description, and category.
    * Assignment to a specific Trello board member.
    * Complex recurring frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) with specific time settings.
    * Optional start and end dates.
* **Manual Card Creation:** A "Create Now" button allows users to manually trigger the creation of a Trello card for any schedule, outside of its regular recurring timeline.
* **Clone Schedules:** Users can easily duplicate an existing schedule with a single click, making it fast and easy to create similar schedules.

### For Administrators:

* **Admin-Only Navigation:** A dedicated "Admin" section in the sidebar provides access to all administrative features.
* **Dashboard & Statistics:** A dashboard page displays key application metrics, including total schedules, total cards created, and breakdowns of activity by user and category.
* **Application Settings:** A secure settings page allows administrators to configure the application's connection to the Trello API, including the API key, token, and target board/list IDs.
* **User Management:** Administrators have full control over user accounts, including the ability to:
    * Create new users with either 'admin' or 'user' roles.
    * Delete existing users.
    * Reset a user's password, which generates a new, secure temporary password.
* **Audit Log:** A detailed audit log provides a chronological record of all important events in the application, including user actions (like creating a schedule or deleting a user) and system events (like a scheduler run).

## ðŸš€ Deployment with Docker

This application is designed to be deployed as a single Docker container.

### Building the Production Image

To build the production-ready Docker image, run the following command from the root of the repository:

*(Note: If you are rebuilding to get the latest code from the repository, you may need to use the `--no-cache` flag to ensure a fresh clone: `docker build --no-cache ...`)*

### Running the Container

To run the application, you must provide the following environment variables to the `docker run` command.

```docker build -t trello-card-scheduler .```

#### Required Environment Variables

* **Database Connection:**
    * `DB_HOST`: The hostname or IP address of your PostgreSQL database.
    * `DB_USER`: The username for the database connection.
    * `DB_PASSWORD`: The password for the database connection.
    * `DB_NAME`: The name of the database.
    * `DB_PORT`: The port your database is running on (defaults to `5432`).
* **JWT Secret:**
    * `JWT_SECRET`: A long, random, and secret string used to sign authentication tokens.
* **Timezone:**
    * `TZ`: The timezone for the scheduler to run in (e.g., `"America/New_York"`).

#### Optional Admin Credentials

* **`ADMIN_USERNAME`**: The username for the initial administrator account. If not provided, it defaults to `admin`.
* **`ADMIN_PASSWORD`**: The password for the initial administrator account. If not provided, it defaults to `changeme` and a warning will be logged. It is **highly recommended** to set this in a production environment.

#### Example `docker run` Command
